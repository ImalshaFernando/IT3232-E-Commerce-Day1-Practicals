# IT3232-E-Commerce-Practicals Day1
This repository contains programming exercises on loops, classes, and OOP concepts. Tasks range from basic printing and number manipulation to advanced implementations like student management, library systems, and retail store management using inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## List of Exercises
1. **Basic Printing**
   - Print a simple message.
   - Print numbers from 1 to 10.
   - Print numbers in reverse.
   - Print odd numbers between 1 to 20.

2. **Loop-Based Number Reversal**
   - Reverse the left and right parts of a number list using only loops.
   - Example:
     ```
     Input: 9
     Output: 4 3 2 1 5 9 8 7 6

     Input: 13
     Output: 6 5 4 3 2 1 7 13 12 11 10 9 8
     ```

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Tasks**
   - **Student Class**  
     - Create a `Student` class.
     - Instantiate 5 student objects and store them in a data structure.
     - Calculate the average marks of the students.

   - **Library System**  
     - Implement classes for different types of books (Printed books, E-books, Audio books).
     - Apply OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

   - **Retail Store System**  
     - Create a store that can store, edit, and delete multiple product types (Fruits, Vegetables, Grocery, etc.).
     - Display available products with details like price, name, and quantity.
